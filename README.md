# 🛒 Amazon Product Review Analysis

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon product and review data to generate insights that support better pricing, product positioning, and customer engagement strategies. The analysis was done using Microsoft Excel, including Pivot Tables, calculated columns, and visualizations.

## 📂 Dataset
- [`amazon_raw_data.xlsx`](data/amazon_raw_data.xlsx) — Original dataset
- [`amazon_cleaned.xlsx`](data/amazon_cleaned.xlsx) — Cleaned dataset used for analysis

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Average discount by product category
- Product count and review volume by category
- Distribution of product ratings
- Revenue estimation from reviews
- Discount vs Rating relationship
- Top-performing products based on ratings & review count
- Price range segmentation

## 📈 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Data cleaning
  - Custom formulas
  - Charts (bar, column, scatter)
  - Dashboard design

## 📄 Deliverables
- [`amazon_pivot_outputs.xlsx`](analysis/amazon_pivot_outputs.xlsx) — Pivot table results
- [`amazon_dashboard.xlsx`](dashboard/amazon_dashboard.xlsx) — Excel dashboard
- [`rating_vs_discount_scatter.png`](analysis/rating_vs_discount_scatter.png) — Chart showing rating vs discount

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Electronics and Home & Kitchen are among the most reviewed and discounted categories.
- High discounts don’t always translate to high ratings — quality might be sacrificed.
- Products with higher rating × review volume tend to be mid-priced and well-placed.
- The majority of products fall in the ₹200–₹500 range, but high revenue comes from higher-priced, highly rated items.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Focus on promoting mid-range, well-rated products with solid review volume.
- Avoid excessive discounting if it leads to lower customer satisfaction.
- Push under-reviewed but high-rated products with influencer campaigns or bundled deals.
